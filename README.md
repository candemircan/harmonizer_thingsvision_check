checking whether extracting features from [Harmonized models](https://github.com/serre-lab/harmonization) directly and from [thingsvision](https://thingsvision.github.io/AvailableModels.html#harmonization) gives the same outputs.

Run `main.sh` to reproduce the results. The script specifically calls `python3.9` to create a virtual environment, so make sure to have it in path. 

The testing was done on a Linux machine. It does not work on Mac because of some dependency problems, and I have not tested Windows.
